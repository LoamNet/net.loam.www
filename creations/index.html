It brings more strategy and consideration to the table, and is going to first be available in late 2019 for PC, and Android in early 2020!</p>

<h1>Creative Services</h1>

<p class="maxed">Need some help with your latest and greatest project? Let us know! We do everything from small, one-off comission style tasks to large, multi-month contracts! And because we love groan-inducing loam puns, we've separated our services into different tiers that help capture process and time differences. You don't need to know which tier your task fits into tho, so feel free to <a href="/contact">contact us<!--i class="fa fa-link fa-xs"></i--></a>, and we'll let you know if and how we can help!

			<h2><strong>Pebbles</strong></h2>
			<p class="text-left">Pebbles are small commission-style tasks that have a one-off payment associated with them. An example of a 'pebble' would be something like creating a single web page, a logo concept, an effect for a Unity game, a couple sound bites, or something else that would generally fit within an afternoon or two.

		<div class="col-lg">
			<h2><strong>Boulders</strong></h2>
			<p class="text-left">Boulders are mid-sized tasks that can generally be broken down into a variety of subtasks. Examples include promotional video creation and editing, interface design, website creation and hosting, and small software tools among other things. Boulders generally take a week or two, and pricing is either done hourly or at a flat rate depending on the task.

		<div class="col-lg">
			<h2><strong>Mountains</strong></h2>
			<p class="text-left">A mountain is a sizable, potentially multi-month contract that a member of Loam undertakes in order to develop a project. A mountain can range from creating an app or smaller game from scratch up to a part-time contract position lasting as long as needed. Pricing is always done hourly.
