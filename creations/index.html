			<h2><strong>Pebbles</strong></h2>
			<p class="text-left">Pebbles are small commission-style tasks that have a one-off payment associated with them. An example of a 'pebble' would be something like creating a single web page, a logo concept, an effect for a Unity game, a couple sound bites, or something else that would generally fit within an afternoon or two.

			<h2><strong>Boulders</strong></h2>
			<p class="text-left">Boulders are mid-sized tasks that can generally be broken down into a variety of subtasks. Examples include promotional video creation and editing, interface design, website creation and hosting, and small software tools among other things. Boulders generally take a week or two, and pricing is either done hourly or at a flat rate depending on the task.

			<h2><strong>Mountains</strong></h2>
			<p class="text-left">A mountain is a sizable, potentially multi-month contract that a member of Loam undertakes in order to develop a project. A mountain can range from creating an app or smaller game from scratch up to a part-time contract position lasting as long as needed. Pricing is always done hourly.
