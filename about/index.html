<h1>About Loam</h1>
<h2 class="loam-section-title">Who We Are</h2>
<div class="maxed">
	<p>Loam creates games and apps, and helps indie content creators with resources and publishing to help create their own games, apps, art, and other media. We make money by selling software and physical goods (like <a href="https://derg.ink">dragon ink</a>), by providing paid technology services, and through donations! The goal is less about profit and more about making cool stuff, and using that cool stuff to fund more cool stuff.</p>
	<!--p>Even tho we're not a non-profit, we want to be fully transparente about our income and expensesamong other things. Hopefully this will provide insight into the flexibiltiy we do and don't have, and how we operate!</p-->
