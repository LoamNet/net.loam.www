      <p>I'm an Indie creator making things both physically and digitally - primarily handmade paper, watercolor, and some games. I've also got some resources posted with tips, tricks, templates, and things I've learned along the way. If you want to provide support, feel free to <a href="ko-fi.com/loamnet"><u>donate</u></a> some spare change!</p>

      <p>If you're interested in getting in touch for consulting services or paper products, please reach out to <a href="mailto:inquiries@loam.net">inquiries@loam.net</a></p>
